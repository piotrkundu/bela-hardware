Revision History:

A1 (January 2015)	Internal build.
A2 (May 2015)		First public release. Revised and clarified silkscreen text.
A3 (May 2015)		Fixed soldermask on IC4.
A4 (October 2015)	Replaced J1 with a header for +5V to amps (left DNI in BOM).
			Moved FB4 next to J1 so it can be removed to disconnect +5V.
			The above changes allow amp to be powered separately from BBB/G.
			Changed J7 and J8 to sockets rather than pins.
B1 (March 2016)		Moved J7, J8, J9, J10 to align to 0.1" spacing.
			Added SW1 and R6 for a system shutdown request feature.
			Moved J3-J6 upward slightly to make room for SW1.
			Added test point for Vref on ADC.
			Fixed incorrect labels on J2.
			Changed order of DAC channels on label for J8 (needs to be
			matched with a software change).
			Added better labelling on connectors throughout.
			Changed name to Bela and website to bela.io.
			Added Bela logo on silkscreen.
B2 (September 2017)	Changed C28 and C29 from 0.1uF to 1uF.
			Connected unused pins of J10 to ground.
			Added test point for MICBIAS signal on IC6.
B3 (October 2019)	Changed protection circuit on analog inputs to use Schottky
			diodes to 3.3V and ground rather than ESD protectors.
			Changed power amp feedback resistors R7 and R14 to 43k,
			doubling gain of the amplifiers.
			Reduced headphone resistors R11 and R12 to 15 ohms, increasing
			gain for low impedance headphones.
			Added pulldown resistors on headphone outputs in place of 47pF
			capacitors.
			Silkscreen updated for latest Bela logo and copyright.
